### LSTM(Long Short Term Memory):

LSTM networks are a type of RNN that uses special units in addition to standard units. LSTM units include a 'memory cell' that can maintain information in memory for long periods of time. ... Standard RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) suffer from vanishing and exploding gradient problems
