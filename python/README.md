#### Shallow copy : copy.copy(lst_a)

A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements.
Hence, if you make a change in the original object, it would reflect in the copied object

#### deep copy : copy.deepcopy(lst_a) 

Deep copy stores copies of an object's values.
Deep copy doesn't reflect changes made to the new/copied object in the original object
